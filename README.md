# Software Engineering

Materials for my class “software engineering” (University of Warsaw, 2023).

## Class 1: Modern Development Environment

Preparation: 
* Repository: Create GitHub accounts and test [SSH access](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
* IDE: install locally [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and integrate with GitHub; alternatively, look into cloud-powered [GitHub CodeSpaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview/)
* Project templating: [use Cookiecutter tool](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.0/README.html#a-pantry-full-of-cookiecutters) to create a minimal Python or Java project.
* Add simple tests and [enable continuous integration by GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests)
* Add a [workflow badge](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge) to your repo, to confirm that it builds and tests properly!
