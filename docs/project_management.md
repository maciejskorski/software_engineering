# Class 4: Software project management

Jira (also in its free plan) allows teams to organise tasks in sprints, track and document the progress.

During this class we will create a backlog of tasks, assign them to project memebers and map them to sprints.

```{note}
[Stories/tasks should occupy one sprint](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Software-questions/Jira-Roadmaps-how-to-extend-stories-across-multiple-sprints/qaq-p/1793636).
Remember the [INVEST](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/invest/) acronym: a story is *I*ndependent, *N*egotiable, *V*aluable, *E*stimable, *S*mall and *T*estable
```

See this roadmap with tasks mapped to sprints:

Jira offers a lot of configurable features. Under the project settings you can enable reporting modules, notifications rules, and so on.
 

The recommended collaborative work strategy is to follow [github flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

Roughly speaking, a developer is *working on tasks in dedicated branches* and *integrates via reviewed pull requests* once a feature or a bug fix is ready.
