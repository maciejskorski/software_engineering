# Class 9: More on Agile

## Scrum Roles

```{important}
There are 3 roles:
* scrum development team member
* product owner
* scrum master

Scrum roles != job titles
```

## Sprint Planning

The whole team defines what will be delivered in the sprint and how to achieve that.

```{important}
Follow these guideliness
* enforce time limit
* keep backlog updated
* goal first, solutions next 
```

The following figure (source: www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) illustrates sprint planning

```{note}
Unlike in sport, in scrum we sprint continuously, delivering and learning.
