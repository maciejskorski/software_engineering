# Class 9: More on Agile

## Scrum Roles

```{important}
There are 3 roles:
* scrum development team member
* product owner
* scrum master

Scrum roles != job titles
```

## Sprint Planning

The whole team defines what will be delivered in the sprint and how to achieve that.

```{important}
Follow these guideliness
* enforce time limit
* keep backlog updated
* goal first, solutions next 
```

The following figure (source: www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) illustrates sprint planning

```{note}
Unlike in sport, in scrum we are sprinting continuously, delivering and learning.
```

## Stand-up

Short update meetings.
```{tip}
* What I did yesterday?
* What to do today?
* Any blockers?
```

## Sprint Reviews

```{important}
During sprint reviews
* Celebrate work done (do demos, ask questions, give feedback)
* Ensure psychological safety, take actions if the experience is not positive
```

```{note}
The problems may be caused, for instance, by:
* unclear objectives
* workload
* technical debt
* scope creep 
```

Sprint reviews are not retrospectives. Reviews focused on deliveries while retrospectives reflect on the human side of work.
