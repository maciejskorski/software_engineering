# Class 4: Software project management

Jira (also in its free plan) allows teams to organise tasks in sprints, track and document the progress.

During this class we will create a backlog of tasks, assign them to project memebers and map them to sprints.

See this roadmap with tasks mapped to sprints:

The recommended strategy of working with git is to use [github flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

Roughly speaking, a developer is *working on tasks in dedicated branches* and *integrates via reviewed pull requests* once a feature or a bug fix is ready.
